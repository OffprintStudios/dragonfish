  # WARNING ABOUT USAGE: Do not attempt to re-run this workflow, as the 'workflow_run' trigger
  # used by the deployment step implicitly has a ${{ github.sha }} of the SHA of the latest commit
  # on the HEAD.
  # The "dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v2" action used in the deploy step looks for a workflow
  # run triggered by that commit.
  # If you attempt to re-run this step after the HEAD has moved forward, it will complete successfully,
  # but then deployment will look for a workflow with the newest commit SHA, which _this_ run did not use.
