# What is Offprint?

Offprint is a community-focused writing site for fanfiction, original stories, and blog posts. Our goal is to provide a place where authors can form communities for their readers, promote themselves, and collaborate with other authors. We are constantly building up features to encourage this, and quickly respond to user feedback. Offprint aims to be a safe and welcoming space, and as such is committed to excluding exceptionally harmful content and users.

Offprint is built on open source software, hosted on Github, and welcomes contributions. The site is funded entirely by donations, and there are no advertisements.
