# The Offprint Omnibus

Note that this will likely be expanded in a newer version.

Ratings for works are defined as such.
- Everyone
    - Should be suitable for all audiences, according to staff discretion.
- Teen
    - Light use of adult themes is permitted. No depictions of heavy gore, sexual acts, or gratuitous violence. Some coarse language is okay, but it should be noticeably less prevalent than in Mature and Explicit ratings.
- Mature
    - Heavy use of adult themes, gore, and violence are permitted. Explicit depictions of sexual acts are not permitted.
    - All adult themes must be given appropriate content warnings.
- Explicit
    - Same as Mature, except that explicit depictions of sexual acts are permitted.
    - Note that works rated Explicit are not necessarily porn/erotica. This rating should also be used for works that feature explicit sexual acts but don’t make them the focus of the story, or don’t intend to arouse the reader.

The following rules apply generally to works
- Plagiarism is prohibited
    - This includes publishing another author’s work as your own.
    - This includes modifying existing works with changed character names and details, but otherwise keeping the prose the same.
- Re-uploading content that was previously removed by staff without staff approval is prohibited
- Fictional works focusing on real persons have some restrictions
    - Works that focus on living public figures and celebrities are prohibited. Deceased historical figures from a long time ago are allowed, but the closer to the present day they are from, the more likely that they won’t be allowed.
    - Works may feature other site users or real persons with their permission. Should those persons request the content be removed, or staff doubt that permission was obtained, the work shall be removed by staff pending a conversation with the author.
    - In the case of fanfiction based on stories where actors play characters named after themselves, care must be taken to reflect the fictional character and not the real person in the work.
    - Mentions of and minor appearances from real persons may be allowed if they don’t play a significant role in the story. They can’t be major enough to be tagged as characters.
- Attempts to work around the restrictions of ratings are prohibited
    - An innocent mistake will result in staff requesting a change in rating, but if they determine it was deliberate, stronger actions will be taken.
- While works won’t be rejected for their content, as long as they don’t break any rules, works with bad grammar and spelling to the point of being incomprehensible will be rejected
- Enough of each work must be in English for staff to accurately moderate them
- Otherwise, anything that breaks the Code of Conduct is prohibited

The following rules regard adult themes.
- Sexual situations involving minors
    - No content that encourage pedophilia may be posted.
    - All characters depicted in explicit sexual or fetishized situations must be above the age of 18.
    - Explicit sexual or fetishized situations involving characters who are stated to be above the age of 18 that are written excessively as childlike, up to staff discretion, shall be considered an attempt to circumvent these restrictions. The same applies to non-human characters.
    - Simply stating that two teenage characters had sex is allowed. You may depict the events immediately before and after teenage characters have sex, but not the sex itself.
- Incest
    - Depictions of incest between consenting adults and exporations of incest as a form of abuse are allowed only at ratings Teen and above.
    - Depictions of parent-child incest are prohibited except in works that aim to explore it as a form of abuse.
    - Positive depictions of incest involving minors are prohibited.
- Rape and non-con
    - Works that romanticize rape or non-consensual sexual situations, or use them for pornographic or erotic purposes, are not allowed.
    - Works depicting rape or non-consensual sexual actions are allowed on the site, in the interest of exploring the consequences and ramifications or treating it as a component of a larger story, but never with the goal of glorifying or justifying the situation.
    - More than any other adult theme, works depicting this must provide appropriate content warnings.
    - Works depicting rape and non-consensual sexual situations shall receive extra scrutiny from staff.
- Dub-con
    - Works depicting dubious consent shall receive extra scrutiny from staff.
    - Attempting to pass off works that should be tagged as non-consensual as dub-con shall be met with direct moderator action, potentially including a suspension of your posting privileges.
